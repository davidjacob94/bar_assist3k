Arduino design project - ECE 303

This project is a drink dispenser controlled by an Arduino Uno 

Demonstration is the sketch used in our lab demonstration of the device
drink_mixer_w_serial_comm was used to test communicating over the serial port of a PC

tuning_forward/reverse each slowly rotate each motor with a button press to enable us to easily align the drive shafts for testing.

cc3000_recieve_UDP_test is a non-working sketch that attempts to utilize the wifi shield as a UDP server.

indiv_motors rotates each motor forwards and backwards with an independent button push.
